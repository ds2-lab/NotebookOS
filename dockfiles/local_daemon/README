# Building

In order to build the `local-daemon` component, you must have the [pebbe/zmq4](https://github.com/pebbe/zmq4) repository cloned in your `$GOPATH`. 

The `pebbe/zmq4` go module as well as the `local_daemon` itself require [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/download/) be installed:
``` sh
apt-get install libzmq3-dev
```

You also must intsall the `pkg-config` utility:
``` sh
apt-get install pkg-config
```
